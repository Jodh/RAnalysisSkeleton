R Analysis Skeleton
=====================

This project contains the files and settings commonly used in analysis projects with R.  A developer can start an analysis repository more quickly by copying these files.  The purpose of each directory is described in its README file.  Some aspects are more thoroughly described in [Collaborative Data Science Practices](https://ouhscbbmc.github.io/data-science-practices-1/).

Pipelines
=====================

The repo contains two pipelines that aim to be simple enough to understand, yet complex enough to mimic aspects frequently seen in analysis projects
