R Analysis Skeleton
=====================

> [No one beginning a data science project should start from a blinking cursor.](https://towardsdatascience.com/better-collaborative-data-science-d2006b9c0d39) <br/>...Templatization is a best practice for things like using common directory structure across projects...<br/>

This project contains the files and settings commonly used in analysis projects with R.  A developer can start an analysis repository more quickly by copying these files.  The purpose of each directory is described in its README file.  Some aspects are more thoroughly described in [Collaborative Data Science Practices](https://ouhscbbmc.github.io/data-science-practices-1/).

Pipelines
=====================

The repo contains two pipelines that aim to be simple enough to understand, yet complex enough to mimic aspects frequently seen in analysis projects
