# The GitHub desktop client makes it easy to right-click a file and select 'ignore'.
#   DThis will append the file name to the bottom of `.gitignore`.
#   So the lines below should either be
#     1. removed (because they were added unintentionally), or
#     2. reorganized and moved above this chunk (so it won't be confused with files added unintentionally).
